KBL-Editor

==============================================

This program allows you to visualize keyboard
layout files (KBL) of Symbitz Software's
PopOnTop keyboard replacement for Symbian UIQ
devices.

The program itself should be self-explanatory.
The left area is the working space which
contains the keyboard layout you are working
on. You can open and save your work using the
buttons above the text area. THE PROGRAM WON'T
ASK YOU TO SAVE YOUR WORK BEFORE EXITING!

The right hand side shows a preview of the
keyboard so that you get an idea how it
looks like. Use the SpinControl next to the
"Visualize!"-button to select the map you
want to see.

Landscape keyboards are not yet supported.

I don't take *ANY* responsibility for any
damage to your computer which might occur by
using this program.

Please make sure the file KBLEdit.bmp is in
the same directory as KBLEdit.exe. If you
rename KBLEdit.exe, do so with KBLEdit.bmp.

Feel free to replace KBLEdit.bmp by a screen-
shot of your own Px00. (208x320 pixels)
